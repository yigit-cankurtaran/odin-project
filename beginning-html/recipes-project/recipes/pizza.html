    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a classic Italian pizza. It's one of my favorite foods to make and to eat.</p>
    <p>To make a great pizza you need experience, skill, and quality ingredients. Ingredients such as:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Wheat flour
      </li>
      <li>
        Water
      </li>
      <li>
        Salt
      </li>
      <li>
        Olive oil
      </li>
      <li>
        Cheese
      </li>
      <li>
        Tomato Sauce
      </li>
      <li>
        Mozzarella Cheese
      </li>
      <li>
        Basil leaves
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The steps to use these ingredients go as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Mix flour, water, salt and some olive oil to make the dough</li>
      <li>Let dough rest for 3 to 4 hours</li>
      <li>Cut dough into balls and use a rolling pin to make them flat and circular</li>
      <li>Put as much as tomato sauce, cheese and some olive oil on top of the dough</li>
      <li>Bake at your preferred temperature for around 60 minutes.</li>
      <li>Enjoy the pizza you created.</li>
    </ol>
